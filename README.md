## Related work

- [elf](https://github.com/wangbj/elf) - does not write ELF, only parses it
- [data-elf]() - parses just headers/tables; depends on a library that fails to build with modern GHCs

## History

For the early history look at the branch "[amakarov](https://github.com/aleksey-makarov/elf/tree/amakarov)" of
the my copy of the [elf](https://github.com/aleksey-makarov/elf) repo.
