'tiny' was generated this way on a 64bit linux system:

  $ nasm -f elf64 tiny.asm
  $ gcc -o tiny tiny.o -nostartfiles -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs
  $ strip -s tiny
  $ strip --remove-section=.note.gnu.build-id tiny

Thank you whoever wrote this tutorial: <http://timelessname.com/elfbin/>.

'bloated' was generated this way on a 64bit linux system:

  $ clang++ -m32 -o bloated bloated.cpp

This HOWTO is provided for documentation purposes, elf should not be
regenerated/changed because tests assert their content. Their content was read
by the readelf utility command.
